Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pyranges Plot requires Python â‰¥ 3.12 and can be installed using pip. To install all
dependencies in order to be able to use all the functionalities of the package and
both engines, the [all] option must be specified: ::

    pip install pyranges-plot[all]

Note that the minimal installation by :code:`pip install pyranges-plot` is not able to produce
plots since the graphical dependencies are not installed.
